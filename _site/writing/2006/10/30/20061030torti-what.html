<p>what a week!! Jennifer and i had quite the parenting adventure this past week and let me tell you, it was a test I think we passed and then some. Our pediatrician notified us that noah had a small knot in his neck muscle and that we should have it checked out by a specialist. One week, a surgeon, and a two hour appointment with a physical therapist later, diagnosed noah as having “infantile torticollis” (basically, a pulled neck muscle) on his right side. We were advised on a series of stretches to do with him in order to work it out. I have to say, the first couple of days after our diagnosis (and some nasty scare tactic photos from the pt) and i was pretty much freaking out, ready to snatch up what ever info i could find on this disorder and what we could do to try and thwart its advancement. I have since calmed down… we’re doing the stretches and are already seeing a huge improvement in his mobility’s. Overall the pt was amazed at his ability to follow objects, his hand eye coordination, ect. So disaster over. I tell you what, this parenting thing is enough to make anyone neurotic!!!</p>

<p>So, I’ve attached a pic of Jennifer and noah this weekend. Noah’s starting to lose his hair (the new stuff looks BLONDE!!) but his eyes are still that slate grey (just in case you were wondering mom) It was really a great weekend!! Thanks for keeping us in your thoughts and prayers!</p>
