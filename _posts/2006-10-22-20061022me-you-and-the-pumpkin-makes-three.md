so we dressed noah in this adorable farmers outfit ready to undergo our horse drawn hay ride to the pumpkin patch to pick our faves this year but it was so blasted cold (it snowed here again last night and pretty much covered everything around) that little Noah had to stay bundled the entire time. he did get a lot of attention even tucked away and one of our admirers took a pic of the family. Just wanted to share it with you guys!
