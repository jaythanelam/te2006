ok guys. Jennifer and I have been working hard at keeping up with this blog and writing about how things are going, pretty much centering most of our thoughts around our new fantastic little family.

I love that we have gotten so much positive feedback about Noah and what he&#8217;s been up too, but had no idea so many people were checking out the blog! so please when you get a minute, post a comment. It doesn&#8217;t have to be about us or noah or even what the post is about but whatever it is you&#8217;re up to&#8230; we&#8217;d love to hear it. We started this because we were so far away from all of you and didn&#8217;t want our family or Noah to miss out on his progress. We also want to know what&#8217;s going on with you guys and this is an easy portal to communicate with the whole family.

(speaking of progress) I haven&#8217;t gotten it on camera yet but he has a new angry face that is just adorable! and it&#8217;s these kind of milestones that we want to share!! So keep in touch.

We love you guys.
