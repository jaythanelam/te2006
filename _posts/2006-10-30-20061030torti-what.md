what a week!! Jennifer and i had quite the parenting adventure this past week and let me tell you, it was a test I think we passed and then some. Our pediatrician notified us that noah had a small knot in his neck muscle and that we should have it checked out by a specialist. One week, a surgeon, and a two hour appointment with a physical therapist later, diagnosed noah as having &#8220;infantile torticollis&#8221; (basically, a pulled neck muscle) on his right side. We were advised on a series of stretches to do with him in order to work it out. I have to say, the first couple of days after our diagnosis (and some nasty scare tactic photos from the pt) and i was pretty much freaking out, ready to snatch up what ever info i could find on this disorder and what we could do to try and thwart its advancement. I have since calmed down&#8230; we&#8217;re doing the stretches and are already seeing a huge improvement in his mobility&#8217;s. Overall the pt was amazed at his ability to follow objects, his hand eye coordination, ect. So disaster over. I tell you what, this parenting thing is enough to make anyone neurotic!!!

So, I&#8217;ve attached a pic of Jennifer and noah this weekend. Noah&#8217;s starting to lose his hair (the new stuff looks BLONDE!!) but his eyes are still that slate grey (just in case you were wondering mom) It was really a great weekend!! Thanks for keeping us in your thoughts and prayers!
