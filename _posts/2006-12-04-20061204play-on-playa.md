Yep, we had our first play date on Saturday. It was so fun. I mean there was something so nice about being with people who understood our new founded interest in poo, spit up, and the varieties of going out with a newborn. Alicia and Janko&#8217;s son oliver is almost the exact age Noah is, so it was fun to compare stories and life changing milestones. Oliver was so talkative and fell right to sleep on his play mat. I immediately got home and tried to see if i could get Noah to fall asleep while playing, it was a no-go. he&#8217;s more of a &#8220;pick me up and make us really work for it&#8221; kind of guy. There&#8217;s a scene in The wedding crashers movie where vince vaugne is making balloon animals for the kids and one kid says &#8220;make me a bicycle clown&#8221;. Noah&#8217;s sentiments run along those same lines.

I can&#8217;t complain. I&#8217;ve always admired a man who knows what he wants!! but after seeing sweet little oliver, i&#8217;m not giving up. So, we had pizza talked with adults and had a laid back day. It was so funny to see the two babies side by side. I&#8217;ll post pics as I get them!
