Sorry guys, Life is hard to keep up with sometimes and while we&#8217;re still taking all kinds of snap shots of Noah and his daily achievements, I have a hard time finding a moment to post them and share!

We&#8217;ve had a great week!! Noah took his first bottle, he&#8217;s smiling at both Jennifer and I constantly, he&#8217;s reaching and just strting to grasp objects,

Our week coming up is just as exciting. We start our mom and baby yoga class! And have our 2 month check up!! So send us good thoughts!
