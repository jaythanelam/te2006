I don&#8217;t have enough time, and don&#8217;t think i ever will, to truly do justice to this past holiday. it was fantastic, it was crazy, it was wonderful to be with our family. Jennifer is going to upload the rest of our pictures into an account so that all of you can share in these memories but here&#8217;s a glimpse of our blooming little boy. He has expanded his faces and vocabulary after a week with the davenport&#8217;s and we were only able to captured half of them!!

Mom, Dad, Jason, Emily, we love you! We are so blessed to have you in our lives.
