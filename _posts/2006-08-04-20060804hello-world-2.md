i can&#8217;t believe we&#8217;ve finally got this up and running! now that we have, i have no idea what to write about. I&#8217;ve been trying to think of some fun and interesting topic but when it comes down to it, i don&#8217;t know where to begin! So i did some research and checked out some other blogs. Blogging seems to be a mix of eclectic voyeurism where you talk about the people around you and what happened to you that day to the obscure topics that usually only apply to you and a select few others that also share your interests. I&#8217;m not saying i don&#8217;t love it, i mean there are days when all i want to do is bash the hell out of my neighbors and their incessant tinkering that only comes from being holed up in the suburbs but then again, there are so many things happening out there that are really note worthy!

So.. here we are at the beginning! Hope its going to be a fun ride!!
