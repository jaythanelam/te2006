Noah and I drove up to Appleton WI on Thursday to see an old old friend of mine. Appleton is about 2 hours north of Madison and ended up being such a cute little city! Renny actually lives in New York with her hubby Brandon but was recently invited into a production company putting on &#8220;a Christmas Story&#8221; all over the country. Its been about 10 years since we last saw each other so the reunion was long over due and sooo much fun!

The play was fantastic! It was so crazy seeing her up on stage commanding the hundreds of people watching. noah and I sat about 5 rows back from the stage right next to the orchestra section. I have to tell you, i was nervous sitting so far away from any exits but ren had reserved us these great seats so we sat&#8230; and Noah loved it. He was an angel the entire production watching the lights and getting serenaded by the orchestra. It was really such an experience.

Afterwards, Ren and I caught up on the logistics of what&#8217;s been happening in our lives. Since we first met at horseback riding camp in about the 5th grade it was neat comparing wedding stories and baby antidotes. It was really great. My camera ran out of batteries early on so shes going to send me some better pics but this is us hanging out with the cast after the show.

It was a great trip!
