Great Christmas, Gift certificate christmas, cold christmas!! Yep we had it all! The Davenport-Elam clan met up in madison and then headed for the [wisconsin dells](http://www.madcitythree.com/www.dells.com "wisconsin dells") to try our luck with the water slides, wave pools, and park security (as dogs were not allowed and emily had to be sumggled). We went to a dinner theater production of a christmas story and screamed down a tolet bowl-like water slide, we bonded holding on for dear life in the wave pool, we laughed, we sassed, we prayed, it was a fantastic holiday. Check out the rest of our [christmas memories](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenniferandJennifers_photos/ "christmas memories")!
