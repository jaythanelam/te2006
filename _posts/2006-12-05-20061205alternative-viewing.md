I am pleased to announce my personnal portfolio site has finally been coded and is up for viewing. Its been a long time com&#8217;n so if your looking for something a little different, or to just waste some time while you&#8217;re at work, then head on over to ![Jennifer's Pretty Little site!](http://www.Jenniferelam.com) for some pretty pictures and a sense of accomplishment.

I should mention that, not only is the design by me but the actual code is as well, so if you are having trouble getting the site to work properly then you should just know that its supposed to that and its &#8220;wrongness&#8221; actually is a demonstration towards the injustices of man.

I don&#8217;t know about you but that sounded kind of good. Cheers!
