I&#8217;m just watching the news stunned at the unfolding airport threats. Apparently the UK uncovered and apprehended a group of terrorists that were going to detonate a bomb targeting 10 planes coming into the U.S. Their plan to combine a red dyed reagent with a sports drink and detonate it using a flash from a disposable camera was thankfully thwarted. It has sense raised the terror threat and has elevated the restrictions to get through airport security requiring passengers to throw away make-up, bottled drinks, tooth paste, anything that resembles a liquid reagent along with banning any electronic devices like cameras, cd players, IPODS!

I&#8217;m not complaining (although i will miss being able to block out the rest of the plane with some  [Kathleen Edwards](http://www.kathleenedwards.com/)). I&#8217;m just a little shocked. I mean come on a sports drink! Just the fact that it was so strategically planned and then nearly executed!! blows me away.

Of course Jennifer and I have the pleasure of hosting the president in our great state today. His always eloquent syntax on the events unfolding are what I can only describe as his usual bumbling misrepresentation of what&#8217;s really going on but since this isn&#8217;t a political rant I digress&#8230;

While the news is iterating that these threats have been solely concentrated in the UK, I think it&#8217;s naive to not focus on the fact that we, the United States were the end target of this attack!! and are still very much at the top of what i can only assume to be a very short hit list. On a personal note, I can&#8217;t help but be worried about the upcoming travel we have planned in our family. i just finished booking tickets for my brother and his wife to come up at christmas not to mention the rest of our family coming up in a matter of weeks for the baby. and my parents as we speak out of the country (alright not technically as they&#8217;re in alaska but whatever!)

If anything maintaining &#8220;CONSTANT VIGILANCE!!!&#8221; 🙂 will help us all to be aware of whats going on out there!

Well, I feel better having gotten this all out! You gotta love having a blog!

thanks for listening.
