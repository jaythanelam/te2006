So, we had another check up today and passed with flying colors. Noah, the heavy weight champ, weighed in at 14.7 lbs and 24.25 inches long. (that&#8217;s a 72% gain from his birth weight) We mastered the lotus in yoga and are going to take a hiatus on bathing for a little while but other than that, he&#8217;s a happy, healthy, growing little man and we couldn&#8217;t feel more blessed.
