I know most of you checking out this blog have some idea of my stance and utmost support of stem cell research, its abilities and implications. Madison is a leader in this emerging field and i have felt lucky to have been in contact with the advancements happening all around us. The political debate has really taken on this issue and with the up and coming elections i thought it important to write. I recently heard James Thomson speak about his personal vestment in the stem cell realm and when asked what he felt about the political aspect of the debate he remain obtrusively aloft. I do not share his tact. I realize that the media has taken this issue and splashed its good but mostly bad side. You will, of course, make your own opinions and assumptions but please! do your own research about the good and the bad before you vote one way or the other. i feel that this research has the capability to change the entire medical field. I feel that given the opportunity to continue, diseases like Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s will become bywords of the past. The following link is a reputable source to truly learn about these cells.<a target="_blank" title="stem cells" href="http://stemcells.nih.gov/index.asp" />
