Jennifer and i celebrated our one year anniversary yesterday. We reminisced over the bachelor party (a little scary) and the bachelorette party (!!), we reread all of the &#8220;words of wisdom&#8221; you all left for us and laughed at the absurdity of suggestions like &#8220;A good marriage stays together if you call Amber every week&#8221; or &#8220;hummers and hot tea will make it last!&#8221;

Our marriage day itself was pretty crazy. At the end of it all, we snuck out of the hotel and walked down the street eating ice cream and talking about what the future held for us. God i miss Chattanooga. I woke up that morning, sat outside watching the sun come up over the city, then Jennifer and i watched it set that night.

Today actually marks the anniversary of our honeymoon, which cannot be discounted as it was the best time I&#8217;ve ever had!! It was so incredibly perfect. It just worked!! Now i know that God gave us that respite in order to get through the sleepless, overworked, craze that our lives have become. We wouldn&#8217;t trade it, but it was nice to reminisce.
