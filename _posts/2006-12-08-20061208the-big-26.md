Well, we celebrated another big birthday for Jennifer yesterday. It was pretty quiet compared to the normal hoopla that we do, but so nice. Noah was great, unusually adaptable and allowed Jennifer and I almost a whole dinner without any mishaps. NE ways, thanks for everybody that called to wish him well. We love you guys!
