Whew!!! We went in for our 2 week check up today. Noah weighed in at 8lbs 5oz when we arrived. He checked out beautifully, we fed while there and weighed again and he weighed in at 8lbs 7oz!! Which means he has gained 1% since his birth! He&#8217;s also measuring at 21 inches!! I know its not huge but every little bit helps. We&#8217;re headed back in next week for another check! here&#8217;s our pic of the day.
